My name is Kin-Ho Lam, my primary contribution to the group was designing and implementing the styles seen on the site. I chose simple colors that go well together to improve fluidity and readability. I used bootstrap&#039;s grid system to create a responsive layout. My favorite part about our website is the use of the &quot;get&quot; function in the profile page. I think that&#039;s a very clever way to display profiles as it gives every member that &quot;individual&quot; look to their profile and creates a very easy way for someone to find and share their presence on our site. Overall I am very happy with the effort my team put into the site. Even though there were a few hiccups along the way, I believe our final product really shows the effort and passion we all hold to make this site really shine.
